GOAL:
Use mouse clicks to move the player


Player stays centered on the screen until reaching the edge of the playing area


Environment made from isometric images


Use the Steamboat Willie sprite as the main character



Step-by-Step Instructions

1. Install Godot 4.x
Download from: https://godotengine.org/download


Use the standard editor, not the mono version (unless you're using C#).



2. Create New Project
Launch Godot


Click "New Project" → Choose a folder → Name it (e.g., IsometricRPG)


Set the renderer to Forward+ or Mobile for Android export


Click "Create & Edit"



3. Setup Project Structure
In the FileSystem tab, create folders:
cpp
CopyEdit
res://
  ├── scenes/
  ├── sprites/
  ├── tiles/
  ├── scripts/


4. Import Your Character Sprite
Download the Steamboat Willie sprite from Itch.io


Drag the images into the sprites/ folder


Select the sprite sheet in the file browser → Set Animation Frames if it’s a sheet


Use SpriteFrames in AnimatedSprite2D for animations like walk_up, walk_down, etc.



5. Create Player Scene
Right-click scenes/ → New Scene


Root node: CharacterBody2D


Add a child node: AnimatedSprite2D → set your sprite


Add another child: Camera2D → set Current = true, Drag Margin H/V = 0


Save scene as player.tscn


Player stays centered because the Camera2D is set to follow it directly.

6. Script the Player Movement (Click-to-Move)
Attach a script to CharacterBody2D:
gdscript
CopyEdit
# scripts/player.gd
extends CharacterBody2D

@export var move_speed := 100.0
var target_position: Vector2

func _ready():
    target_position = global_position

func _input(event):
    if event is InputEventMouseButton and event.pressed:
        target_position = get_global_mouse_position()

func _physics_process(delta):
    var direction = (target_position - global_position).normalized()
    if global_position.distance_to(target_position) > 5:
        velocity = direction * move_speed
        move_and_slide()
    else:
        velocity = Vector2.ZERO


7. Setup the World (Isometric Environment)
Option 1: Static Images
Drag in images as Sprite2D nodes


Position them carefully in isometric layout (approx. 2:1 ratio — e.g., tile 128x64)


Option 2: TileMap (Recommended)
Right-click scenes/ → New Scene


Root node: Node2D


Add a child node: TileMap


Set TileSet to your isometric tiles (create it in the editor)


In the TileMap node:


Set Mode = Isometric


Set cell size to match tiles (e.g., 128x64)


Save scene as world.tscn


7.5 create NPC. 
Squares are friends, they shoot lasers at anything that gets close to the main character 
Swarms of triangles come at the payer. The player must dodge or else instant game over.

8. Create Main Scene
New Scene → Root: Node2D


Add world.tscn as a child


Add player.tscn as a child → position it in the middle of the map


Save scene as main.tscn




9. Set Main Scene & Test
Go to Project > Project Settings > Application > Run > Main Scene


Set it to main.tscn


Press F5 to run


You should see:
Player centered on screen


Click and move behavior


Isometric environment using tiles or images



10. (Optional) Android Export Setup
Once you’re ready to deploy:
Go to Project > Export > Add Android


Follow instructions to set up:


Android SDK


Debug keystore


Export to .apk



Notes
Isometric movement logic is already handled by path direction, but for tile-based isometric A* pathfinding, you'll want a proper navmesh or GridMap later.


You’ll likely want to animate different directions based on click angle.


Use YSort nodes or layers to handle depth layering in an isometric setup.



 Next Steps
Add animation logic (walk in correct direction)


Implement collision detection (walls, objects)


Add NPCs or enemies


Inventory and dialogue systems


Save/load game data
