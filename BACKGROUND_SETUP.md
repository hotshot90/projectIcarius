# Background Configuration Complete! 🎨

## What I've Done:

### ✅ **Moved & Configured Your Background:**
- **Moved** `medieval-hand-drawn-town-map_big.jpg` from `/scenes/` to `/sprites/`
- **Added** background image to the world scene as a Sprite2D
- **Configured** automatic world boundary detection
- **Setup** camera limits based on background size

### ✅ **Enhanced World System:**
- **Created** `world.gd` script for boundary management
- **Added** automatic world bounds calculation
- **Integrated** boundary checking for player movement
- **Setup** camera limits to prevent going outside the map

### ✅ **Player Improvements:**
- **Added** world boundary respect for click-to-move
- **Setup** camera limits based on background size
- **Added** debug messages for out-of-bounds clicks
- **Improved** movement constraint system

## 🎮 **How It Works Now:**

### **Background Display:**
- Medieval hand-drawn town map displays as the game world
- Automatically centered and properly scaled
- Serves as the visual foundation for your RPG

### **Player Movement:**
- Click-to-move only works within the background image bounds
- Camera follows player but stops at map edges
- Player cannot move outside the visible map area
- Console shows "Target outside world bounds" for invalid clicks

### **World Boundaries:**
- Automatically calculated from background image size
- World bounds printed to console on game start
- Camera limits set to match the background dimensions

## 🗺️ **Map Integration:**

Your medieval town map now serves as:
- **Game World**: Visual foundation for the RPG
- **Movement Area**: Defines where players can move
- **Camera Bounds**: Limits how far the camera can pan
- **Visual Context**: Perfect backdrop for Steamboat Willie's adventure

## 🎯 **Ready to Play:**

1. **Open Godot** and load the project
2. **Press F5** to run the game
3. **See your medieval map** as the background
4. **Click to move** Steamboat Willie around the map
5. **Notice** how the camera follows but respects boundaries

## 📐 **Technical Details:**

- **Background Type**: Sprite2D node in world scene
- **Centering**: Automatically centered at world origin (0,0)
- **Bounds**: Calculated from actual image dimensions
- **Camera**: Limited to background boundaries
- **Movement**: Constrained to visible map area

Your medieval town map is now perfectly integrated as the game world! The contrast between the classic hand-drawn medieval setting and the animated Steamboat Willie character creates an interesting and unique aesthetic for your RPG! 🏰🎮
