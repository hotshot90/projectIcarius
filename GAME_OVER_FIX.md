# Game Over System - Error Fixed! âœ…

## Issue Resolved:
Fixed the error: **"Preload file 'res://scenes/game_over.tscn' does not exist"**

## What I Created:

### âœ… **Game Over Scene** (`scenes/game_over.tscn`)
- **Game Over overlay** with semi-transparent background
- **Restart button** to play again
- **Quit button** to exit the game
- **Survival time display** showing how long you lasted
- **Pause-compatible** - works when game is paused

### âœ… **Game Over Script** (`scripts/game_over.gd`)
- **Survival time tracking** from game manager
- **Restart functionality** - reloads the current scene
- **Quit functionality** - exits the game
- **Score display** showing survival time

### âœ… **Enhanced Game Manager** (`scripts/game_manager.gd`)
- **Survival time tracking** from game start
- **Proper game over handling** with UI display
- **Enemy spawn stopping** when game ends
- **Prevents multiple game over calls**

## ðŸŽ® **How It Works Now:**

### **When Game Over Occurs:**
1. **Triangle touches player** â†’ triggers game_over()
2. **Enemy spawning stops** immediately
3. **Game pauses** to freeze all action
4. **Game Over screen appears** with survival time
5. **Player can restart or quit** using buttons

### **Game Over Screen Features:**
- **"GAME OVER"** title text
- **Survival time display** (e.g., "Survival Time: 45.3 seconds")
- **Restart button** - instantly restart the game
- **Quit button** - exit to desktop
- **Semi-transparent overlay** so you can still see the game behind

### **Survival Scoring:**
- **Timer starts** when game begins
- **Tracks total survival time** in seconds
- **Displays precise time** (e.g., 23.7 seconds)
- **Resets on restart** for new attempts

## ðŸš€ **Ready to Play:**

The error is now completely fixed! When you run the game:
1. **No more errors** about missing game_over.tscn
2. **Proper game over handling** when touched by triangles
3. **Clean restart/quit options** for better gameplay flow
4. **Score tracking** to encourage replay and improvement

Your Steamboat Willie RPG now has a complete game over system! ðŸŽ¯
